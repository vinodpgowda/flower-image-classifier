# Petals to the Metal - Flower Classification on TPU Challenge

## Overview     
This repository contains the code for a flower image classifier developed for the "Petals to the Metal - Flower Classification on TPU" challenge on Kaggle. The challenge involves classifying images of flowers into multiple categories using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).

## Challenge Description
The "Petals to the Metal" challenge on Kaggle focuses on flower image classification, requiring participants to build and train models that can accurately identify various flower species based on their images. TPUs are employed to accelerate the training process, and the competition evaluates models based on their performance on a held-out test set.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TPU hardware (for training on TPU)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinodpgowda/flower-image-classifier.git
   cd flower-image-classifier
